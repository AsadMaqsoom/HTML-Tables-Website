                <h2>Treasures of the Boy King</h2>
                <p>Today marks the 100th anniversary of the opening of King Tutankhamun’s mummy case. A ruler of Egypt
                    in the 14th century BCE, “Tut” became king at the age of 9 and died at 19. His burial chamber and
                    its treasures captured the world’s imagination, a fascination heightened by a museum tour in the
                    1970s. Yet for centuries, he was an afterthought. The last of his dynasty, his name was stricken
                    from the royal lists by the next dynasty, so the tomb’s location was forgotten until its 1922
                    discovery.</p>

                <h2>What’s in a Brand Name?</h2>
                <p>Bayer trademarked the name Aspirin, for its drug made from acetylsalicyclic, 125 years ago today.
                    That got us thinking about other products—including popsicles, bubble wrap, kerosene, dumpsters, and
                    velcro—that became household names to the point of ubiquity, replacing the original term. Even the
                    word “zipper” was a brand name once. Here are a few more commonly used terms that started life with
                    a price-tag.</p>
                <h2>Health and wellness</h2>
                <p>Tylenol is often used as short-hand for its generic alias of acetaminophen, while brands such as
                    Xanax (alprazolam), Viagra (sildenafil) and Prozac (fluoxetine), became synonymous with their
                    chemical names. Other popular health-and-wellness brands that evolved into everyday words include
                    Band-Aid, trademarked by Johnson and Johnson in 1920; the Q-tip, introduced in 1926; and Kleenex.
                </p>
                <h2>Fun and games</h2>
                <p>Products aimed at children tend to have fun names—“Hula Hoop” sounds a lot better than “extruded
                    plastic dingus.” The toy company WHAM-O gave us that one, as well as the Frisbee. Other fun product
                    names that entered the lexicon include yo-yo, pogo stick, ping-pong, rollerblade, and jet ski.</p>
                <h2></h2>
                <p>Google, Photoshop, and Taser are a few high-profile examples of brand names that became verbs, just
                    as “to Xerox” once meant to make a copy of something. We also use the words jumbotron and
                    teleprompter interchangeably with the electronic products they represent, though they were product
                    names.</p>
